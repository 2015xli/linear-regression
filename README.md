## A simple tutorial on linear regression programming in python

The tutorial has two implementations, one is self-developed ridge-regression with cost function being MSE + weight-decay regularization; the other is directly invocation of scikit-learn ridge regression function.

The example shows how to fit a line for 2D or a plane for 3D.
