## A simple tutorial on linear regression programming in python 

It has three implementations, 
- self-developed regression with cost function being MSE + weight-decay regularization; 
  -- gradient descent
  -- stochastic gradient descent
- directly invocation of scikit-learn ridge regression function.

The example shows how to fit a line for 2D or a plane for 3D.
